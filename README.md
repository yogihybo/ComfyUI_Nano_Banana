## What's New

### Version 6.1.0 - Nano Banana 2 Support
This minor update adds support for the new Nano Banana 2 model (gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview), optimized for speed and high-volume use cases.

#### New Features:

**New Nano Banana 2 AIO Node:**
A dedicated node for the gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview model with support for:
- Up to 14 reference images (10 objects + 4 characters)
- New aspect ratios: 1:4, 4:1, 1:8, 8:1
- 512px (0.5K) resolution option
- Google Image Search grounding alongside Web Search

**New Nano Banana 2 Multi-Turn Chat Node:**
A conversational image generation and editing node with all Nano Banana 2 features:
- Multi-turn conversations with preserved context
- Up to 14 reference images for iterative editing
- Extreme aspect ratios and 512px resolution
- Google Image Search grounding

**Important:** Before using Nano Banana 2 nodes, please update the `google-genai` package to the latest version:
```bash
pip install google-genai --upgrade
```

### Version 6.0.2 - Auto Aspect Ratio Feature
This patch update adds the "Auto" aspect ratio option, allowing the AI to automatically determine the best aspect ratio for your generated images.

#### New Features:

**Fixed Issue #14:**
Added "Auto" as an additional aspect ratio option in both NanoBananaAIO and NanoBananaMultiTurnChat nodes. When selected, the AI automatically chooses the optimal aspect ratio based on the prompt content.

### Version 6.0.1 - Fix for MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL Issue
This patch update fixes the MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL error that occurred when using the Google GenAI SDK with the gemini-3-pro-image-preview model and Automatic Function Calling (AFC).

#### Fixes:

**Fixed Issue #12:**
The MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL error has been resolved by explicitly disabling Automatic Function Calling (AFC) configuration in the Google GenAI SDK, preventing malformed function call errors when using the gemini-3-pro-image-preview model. The update also includes enhanced error handling.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository into your `custom_nodes` folder.
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/ru4ls/ComfyUI_Nano_Banana.git
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r ComfyUI_Nano_Banana/requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **For Nano Banana 2 AIO and Multi-Turn Chat support**, update the `google-genai` package to the latest version:
    ```bash
    pip install google-genai --upgrade
    ```

## Configuration Setup

You can use either Google Generative AI API approach (simpler) or Google Vertex AI approach (more powerful) depending on your needs.

### Option 1: Google Generative AI API
To use the simpler API approach, you need a Google AI API key. You can obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Please note that the Gemini API is a paid service and may incur costs.

1. Copy the `.env.api.template` file to create your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.api.template .env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
   ```

### Option 2: Google Vertex AI
For access to the full functionality including the thinking process output and enhanced grounding capabilities, use the Vertex AI approach with your Google Cloud Project.

To use this you need a Google Cloud Project with the Vertex AI API & SDK enabled. Refer https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk

1.  **Enable the Vertex AI API:** Follow the instructions in the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment) to enable the API for your project.

2.  **Authenticate Your Environment:** This node uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) to securely authenticate with Google Cloud. Run the following `gcloud` command in your terminal to log in and set up your credentials. This is a one-time setup.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
    The node authenticates directly through the installed Python libraries and does **not** depend on the `gcloud.cmd` executable being available in your system's PATH at runtime.

3.  **Create a `.env` file:** Copy the `.env.vertexai.template` file to create your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.vertexai.template .env
    ```
    Then edit the `.env` file and add your Google Cloud project details:
    ```
    PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
    LOCATION="your-gcp-location"  # e.g., us-central1 (Note: gemini-3-pro models automatically use global endpoint)
    ```

### Automatic Approach Detection
The system automatically detects and uses the available credentials:
- If both PROJECT_ID and LOCATION are set, it uses the Vertex AI approach
- If only GOOGLE_API_KEY is set, it uses the API approach
- If neither is available, an error is shown

## Nodes

### Nano Banana All-in-One (AIO)

This unified node combines all features from the existing nodes into a single, powerful interface. It dynamically adapts its behavior based on the `image_count` parameter: generating a single image (like NanoBananaGrounding) or multiple images (1-10) with the same powerful grounding, search, and thinking capabilities. This is the recommended node for new workflows.

**Inputs:**

*   `model_name` (STRING): The Gemini model to use. Currently using: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for advanced capabilities (default: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`).
*   `prompt` (STRING): The text prompt for image generation or manipulation.
*   `image_count` (INT): Number of images to generate (1-10). When set to 1, behaves like NanoBananaGrounding; when >1, generates multiple sequential images (default: 1).
*   `use_search` (BOOLEAN): Toggle to enable or disable Google Search functionality (default: `True`).
*   `image_1` to `image_6` (IMAGE, optional): Up to six reference images. Provide at least one image for image-to-image generation.

## Example Usage

### Text to Image Generation (with configurable aspect ratio)

1.  Add the `Nano Banana AIO` node to your workflow.
2.  Select your desired `aspect_ratio` from the dropdown (e.g., `16:9` for wide landscape, `9:16` for vertical, etc.).
3.  Enter a `prompt`.
4.  Ensure no `image_` inputs are connected.
5.  Connect the output `image` to a `PreviewImage` or `SaveImage` node to see the result.

**Sample Prompt:** "A cinematic close-up of a transparent glass chess piece (a knight) aimed at the camera. Inside the glass piece, a tiny glowing galaxy swirls with purple and gold nebulae. The background is a dimly lit library with dust motes dancing in a single shaft of volumetric golden hour light striking the chess piece, creating caustic light refractions on the wooden table."

4.  Set your desired `aspect_ratio` and `image_size` parameters.
5.  Execute the node to generate the initial image and response.
6.  For subsequent interactions, use the same node instance with the same parameters but change the `prompt` to continue the conversation and modify the image iteratively.
7.  Use `reset_chat` to start a fresh conversation when needed.
8.  Connect the output `image` to a `PreviewImage` or `SaveImage` node to see the results.
9.  The `chat_history` output shows the complete conversation history.

**Example Workflow:**
- First execution: "Create an image of a clear perfume bottle sitting on a vanity"
